## Distance Metrics for scRNA (DIMES)
We are working on a novel approach to evaluate distance metrics in scRNA analysis. Traditionally, single-cell data
is clustered using Euclidean distance, either in PCA space or in raw, full-dimension space. Recent studies have focused
on more complex evaluation metrics, many of which treat the expression profile of a gene as a probability distribution. This
project builds on prior work by treating coexpression networks as a binary classification problem.
